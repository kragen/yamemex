D pop up an icon on every page with a content script
   D add a content script
   D import jQuery
   D add the icon
       D why is there extra space on top of the icon on http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/browserAction.html?!
D when you click on the icon, open an annotation window
    - make it smoothly animate
D send the annotations to the background page to store in SQL
D get annotations from the background page at startup and don’t show
   the icon if there are none
D make browser action show annotation pane
D store annotations in SQL
D make a page to show all the annotations
- move the tab down a bit
- make annotation page do some minimal formatting at least
- make thingy opaquer when the focus is in it
- make it take focus
- make it dismissable
- It should probably resize vertically as I type more and more stuff.
- making it so I can drag it if I want it to be
   bigger/smaller/some-other-shape.
- hide annotations in an iframe to keep them private from the page
- store the original date on annotations, not the latest change date
- make the placeholder text be selected initially
- make the tab thingy show up earlier, not after page load finishes,
   and similarly for the event handler
- handle URL changes that don’t reload the page; the thing for
   http://www.facebook.com/ shouldn’t
   still be visible when I am on
   http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=109614559124178&notif_t=event_invite
- make "see all" link be text-align:center because it looks great on
