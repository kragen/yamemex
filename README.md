yamemex provides a little margin in which you can jot notes.  It’s an
annotation-centered take on bookmarking.  This version is very
preliminary, but it already provides a reverse-chronological view of
your bookmark annotations.

DONE
----

- saving annotations for bookmarked pages with a resizable annotation
  popup in-page
- reverse-chronological view in browser
- icon on page to indicate that there are annotations

BUGS
----

- hits disk after every keystroke in the annotation window
- malicious JavaScript in a web page can spy on your annotation
- annotation button doesn’t work until page finishes loading
- doesn’t work on framesets

TODO (possibly)
---------------

- smoothly animating open annotation popup
- growing annotation popup taller as you type text into it
- focusing annotation popup when it opens
- hiding annotations from the page in an iframe
- dismissing annotation popup
- storing original date for annotations so they stay in order (perhaps
  linked from latest date)
- auto-selecting placeholder text so you can just start typing instead
  of working to delete the placeholder text for a new annotation
- running when page starts loading, rather than when it finishes loading
- handling URL changes that don't reload the page
- centering "see all" link
- saving favicons
- saving screenshots
- saving page titles
- archiving page contents
- Markdown or similar formatting for annotations

- tagging
- saving highlighted quotations from pages
- automatically parsing dates from pages and displaying bookmarks in a calendar view
- Lotus-Agenda-like auto-tagging based on user-specified keywords
- plugins to seek bibliographic data and enable bookmarking of it
- “friends”
- subscribing to friends’ annotations
- “like” button on friends’ annotations
- Wiki-like editing of friends’ annotations
- real-time updates
- comment threads on annotations
